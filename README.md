# Electrical-quantiies-logger-and-visulization
To logging the electrical quantities (energy, power, voltage, current) from a Industrial energy meter through ModbusRTU Communication Protocol into Raspbarry Piâ€™s local storage in CSV file format and from this file push the data to InfluxDB server which is running on Amazon AWS using JSON protocol to visualize the data in real time. Also we have to log and monitor the whole solar plant like solar inverters, cluster controller, protection relay, solar reverse power controller further.
